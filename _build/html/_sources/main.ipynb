    "In this Jupyter Book we will explore some predictive analytics of NBA basketball. Over recent years, statistical analytics have been used increasingly in commentary across the league to highlight and quantify the feats these athletes achieve game to game and their careers overall. The ability to predict game outcomes has recently become a major topic with the expanding legalization and accessibility to sports betting in the United States. Betters have gone to the lengths of creating statistical models such as the one created in this project in hopes of optimizing and perfecting their \"odds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to generate a fundamental predictive model that accurately predicts game wins based off certain features. The hope is this model is a foundational start to creating more robust and complex models that can more accurately predict real life game situations with all variables involved. \n"

    "The data was accessed using the NBA_API tool that scrubs data from stat.nba.com. The data was then cleaned down to a data frame consisting of GAME_DATE, GAME_ID, WL, MATCHUP, and the PLUS_MINUS total. We used the average plus minus value of the last 10 games to give us a value of measure for the team's performance moving into their next game. We converted the data type on the GAME_DATE column to datetime so we would be able to sort these values from earliest date to present time. The dataset provided us rows of data for both home and away teams for single games so we merged this data on the GAME_ID and then we added a column for the average plus minus of the last 10 games of the home team and the away team. Once we had this data we then took the average plus minus of the last 10 from the home team and the away team and took the difference to account for home court advantage. We then converted the WL columns to binary 1 for win and 0 for loss to be interpreted by the model. The final dataframe we fed into the model consisted of two columns, our converted wins and losses, and our average plus minus of the last 10 games differential."

    "We built a simple regression model using the average difference of the plus minus between the home and away team and the outcome of the game. Using the train_test_split method from sk.learn we split the data set using at test size of 0.2 and a random state of 7. We used XGBoost as our machine learning library as our regularizing gradient boosting framework to use the decision trees to make the predictions. We then trained the model off the train and test data frames. To increase accuracy, we introduced some hyper parameters and used a uniform log distribution for our learning rate. After fitting our parameter to the model we then used the best parameters method to optimize and find our best parameters for the best possible accuracy using these two features. The results before introducing the hyper parameters concluded in an accuracy score of 57% after introducing the hyper parameterization we boosted our accuracy to about 60%. In conclusion, using win performance from the last 10 games and training our model over 3 seasons alone resulted in a 60 percent model accuracy while only using 2 features. Adding more features to this model could result in very accurate model considering the complexity and multiple factors that lead up into a basketball game. "
