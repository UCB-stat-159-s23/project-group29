# NBA Dataset Analysis



## Overview

This project is analyzing NBA data that will then be used to build a regression model that will predict NBA Game winners using past performance. The scientific preface of this project is based on normal assumptions in sports, what factors like previous performance and home court advantage have an affect on winning and are we able to accurately predict NBA games won based on these dependencies? The analysis consists of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and model building.

## Dataset

The data was collected using a known and popular API, NBA_API. The data is made available in the repository and all cleaned versions of the data set are available as well in the data folder.
